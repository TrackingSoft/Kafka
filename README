Kafka package version 0.8001
============================

The Kafka package is a set of Perl modules which provides a
simple and consistent application programming interface (API) to the
Apache Kafka 0.8, a high-throughput distributed messaging system.
The main focus of the package is to provide classes
and functions that allow you to write Apache Kafka clients.


The Kafka package was written, tested, and found working on
recent Linux distributions.

INSTALLATION

To install this package type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.010 or higher. Some modules within this package depend on other
packages that are distributed separately from Perl. We recommend that
you have the following packages installed before you install
Kafka:

   Const::Fast
   Exception::Class
   List::MoreUtils
   Params::Util
   Scalar::Util::Numeric
   String::CRC32
   Sys::SigAction
   Try::Tiny

The Kafka package has the following optional dependencies:

   Capture::Tiny
   Clone
   Config::IniFiles
   Data::Compare
   Proc::Daemon
   Proc::ProcessTable
   Sub::Install
   Test::Deep
   Test::Exception
   Test::TCP

If the optional modules are missing, some "prereq" tests are skipped.

The installation of the missing dependencies can either be accomplished
through your OS package manager or through CPAN (or downloading the source
for all dependencies and compiling them manually).

TESTING

The following environment variable changes the way Kafka Benchmark test behave:

   # The root directory of the installation Kafka 0.8
   KAFKA_BASE_DIR

SIMPLE BENCHMARK

Use tools/benchmark_consumer.pl and tools/benchmark_producer.pl to run a simple
benchmark.
Run one or more consumer or producer instances using tools/benchmark_consumer.pl or
tools/benchmark_producer.pl .
