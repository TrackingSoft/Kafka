Kafka package version 0.08
==========================

The Kafka package is a set of Perl modules which provides a
simple and consistent application programming interface (API) to the
Apache Kafka, a high-throughput distributed messaging system.
The main focus of the package is to provide classes
and functions that allow you to write Apache Kafka clients
without Apache ZooKeeper service.

The Kafka package was written, tested, and found working on 
recent Linux distributions.

INSTALLATION

To install this package type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.010 or better. Some modules within this package depend on other
packages that are distributed separately from Perl. We recommend that
you have the following packages installed before you install
Kafka:

   Digest::CRC
   Params::Util

Digest::CRC version 0.18 has a bug which prevents it from using fast,
XS code if installed via CPAN.
Please install this module manually using
'perl Makefile.PL && make test install' if installed via CPAN shell.

The Kafka package has the following optional dependencies:

   Test::Deep
   Test::Exception

If the optional modules are missing, some "prereq" tests are skipped.

The installation of the missing dependencies can either be accomplished
through your OS package manager or through CPAN (or downloading the source
for all dependencies and compiling them manually).

TESTING

The following environment variables change the way Kafka Benchmark test behave
("t/99_usage/03_kafka_bench.t"):

   # the IO timeout in secs
   KAFKA_BENCHMARK_TIMEOUT = 0.5

   # minimum length of test messages
   KAFKA_BENCHMARK_LEN_MIN = 200

   # maximum length of the test messages
   KAFKA_BENCHMARK_LEN_MAX = 200

   # number of messages for batch testing
   KAFKA_BENCHMARK_PACKAGE = 5000

   # number of messages for a single test
   KAFKA_BENCHMARK_SINGLE = 5

SIMPLE BENCHMARK

Use benchmark_consumer.pl and benchmark_producer.pl to run a simple benchmark.
Run one or more consumer instances using benchmark_consumer.pl .
and one or more producer instances using benchmark_producer.pl .
