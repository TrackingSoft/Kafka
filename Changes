    Add support SASL authentication support

1.07 Sun September 17 2017

    Added support for v1 Messages at Producer side, which allows
    to produce messages with CreateTime timestamp.

      snappy-java multiframes.

    Important fix for offset commit/fetch bug

    In Kafka versions > 0.8.2 offset commits/fetch are stored on
    Kafka itself, not zookeeper (that's version 1 of protocol
    instead of version 0).

    The code before that commit was claiming that it supported
    version 0 for commiting offsets, and version 1 for fetching.
    As a result, offsets were stored on zookeeper, but fetched
    from Kafka, where they were never found.

    This fix provides support for version 1 when storing and
    fetching offsets. It required implementing the API call for
    finding a group coordinator as well.

    - Fix message offsets for messages in compressed MessageSet (Damien Krotkine).
